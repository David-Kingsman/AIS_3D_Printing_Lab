## Project Overview

This repository is a 3D printing model files backup repository for the AIS Construction Lab at McGill University, specifically designed for the lab's Bamboo X1C 3D printer. The repository contains various 3D printing model files required by the laboratory for manufacturing robotic systems, mobile platforms, and related equipment.

## Supported 3D Printers

- **Bambu Lab X1-Carbon** (Primary support)

#### Printing Instructions

**High Priority Items** (Recommended to print first):
- Wheel Mount A & B (8 each) - Core components for caster module
- Breaker Terminal Spacers (5A and 40A, 1 each) - Power distribution panel accessories

**Printing Notes**:
1. All STL files are ready and located in their respective folders
2. Recommend using PLA material for printing
3. Check model dimensions and print settings before printing
4. Some parts may require support structures
5. Please refer to [TidyBot2 documentation](https://tidybot2.github.io/docs/bom/#3d-printing) for printing specifications
