## Daily / Before Each Print

- [ ] Clean the build plate surface (warm water + dish soap is Bambu's recommendation; IPA wipe is OK for quick touch-ups)
- [ ] Check the **nozzle wiper**‚Äîremove stuck filament, ensure it's level and undamaged
- [ ] Look at the **nozzle/hotend tip** for residue; do a quick wipe if needed
- [ ] Inspect the filament path/PTFE tubes (AMS or external) for breaks, kinks, or debris
- [ ] If first-layer or lidar errors appear, gently clean the **Micro Lidar** lens

## Weekly

- [ ] Blow out or vacuum dust from **part-cooling, hotend, and auxiliary fans**
- [ ] Clean the **extruder gears** (yellow gear) with compressed air; replace if visibly worn
- [ ] Wipe the **chamber camera** lens (more often if printing ABS)
- [ ] *(Optional)* Confirm X/Y belt feel & sound; re-tension only if issues arise

---

## Monthly

- [ ] Wipe the **X-axis carbon rods** (no grease) and the **Y/Z linear rods** with IPA; apply light anti-rust oil after
- [ ] Quick visual check of wiring and connectors for wear or looseness *(Good practice though not explicitly in the wiki)*
- [ ] Ensure all external screws/fasteners remain snug *(Good practice)*

---

## Quarterly (Every ~3 Months)

- [ ] **Grease the Z-axis lead screws** lightly and cycle the bed to spread it
- [ ] Apply anti-rust oil to Y/Z rods after cleaning
- [ ] Replace the **activated carbon air filter** (monthly if running production hours)
- [ ] Full-frame deep clean: wipe rails, pulleys, covers, purge chute area
- [ ] Inspect nozzle/hotend for wear or clogs; replace if needed

## Annually (or As Wear Appears)

- [ ] Inspect/replace **X/Y (and Z) belts** if frayed or stretched
- [ ] Replace worn **idler pulley** parts if squeaking persists after oiling
- [ ] Refresh any tired PTFE tubes/couplers‚Äîespecially if you run abrasive filaments

## Essential Spare Parts to Keep On Hand

### Critical Components
- Hotend assemblies / nozzles (0.4 mm, hardened for CF/GF filaments)
- Filament cutter blade (extruder)
- Nozzle wipers
- Activated carbon air filters
- PTFE tubes & couplers (AMS/internal + printer side)

### Lubricants & Maintenance
- Lubricants: light oil for rods (A1 Y-rail uses oil), grease for lead screws
- XY belt kit (if you're running long hours or notice wear)
- Silicone sock for hotend

## Important Notes

- **Direct-Drive Extruder:** Bambu Lab printers use a direct-drive extruder; keep gears clean and check for dust buildup regularly
- **Model-Specific Differences:** A1 / A1 mini have slightly different lubrication guidance (oil vs. grease on certain rails)
- **Production Hours:** If running production hours, consider more frequent maintenance intervals
- **Abrasive Filaments:** If using carbon fiber or glass fiber filaments, increase maintenance frequency
